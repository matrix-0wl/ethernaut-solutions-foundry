# Ethernaut solutions and write-ups in Foundry ðŸ”¨

Each writeup is located in the appropriate level folder.

You can also read my other solutions (using console and/or Remix) on my blog: https://matrix-0wl.gitbook.io/ethernaut/.

_This repository uses the original version of the Ethernaut challenges. It is
not modified to the 0.8 version of Solidity._

## File locations

- individual Llvels can be found in their respective folder located under `src/levels/XX-LevelName`
- tests for each level can be found in the `test` directory under the same name convention as the folders above `XX-LevelName.t.sol`
- each writeup is located in the appropriate level folder
